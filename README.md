The kit requires a CR2032 battery, a CR2032 battery holder and 2 LEDs with a forward voltage higher than 3V. It's designed to cost less than â‚¬1 when bought in volumes of 100. It's a collaboration between [FabLab Leuven](https://www.fablab-leuven.be/), [Trakk](http://www.trakk.be/), [iMal](http://imal.org/) and [Fablab Genk](http://www.fablabgenk.be/). It was designed during the [Objects in Common](http://medialab-prado.es/article/objetos-comunes) organised by the [Medialab Prado](http://medialab-prado.es/) and [Constant VZW](http://www.constantvzw.org/).
